/* In this example, we define a dictionary of collision handlers, where each key is a tuple of the types of the two objects colliding, and each value is a delegate that handles the collision. We then use GetType() to get the actual types of the caller and other objects, and look up the corresponding collision handler in the dictionary. If a handler is found, we invoke it with the caller and other objects as arguments.

Note that this approach requires you to define a separate collision handler for each type of collision you want to handle. However, it gives you a lot of flexibility in terms of which types of objects can collide with each other, and what happens when they collide.
